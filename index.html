                        <p>Is Friday the 13th really the unluckiest day of the year?</p>
                        <p>This project involved analyzing a large traffic accident dataset, then engineering features to figure out how the day of the week can affect the number of expected traffic accidents. This information was used to set a baseline for looking specifically at Friday the 13th and see if it varies significantly from a typical Friday. The results may surprise you.</p>

                        <p>Using a dataset provided by the Social Security Administration, I was able to compare how often males and females were given a particular name to come up with a true neutrality score. During this investigation, it was uncovered that the rarest names can be the most neutral by default -- an interesting find in itself, but not really what a lot of parents want to know. I created multiple levels of filtering to keep the results more interesting to the average person. I created several visualizations to help with the interpretation of the data, and you may be surprised at which names are truly the most neutral (while still being relatively common).</p>

		      <h3>Pythagoras Personal Banking Software</h3>
                        <p>This is personal banking software developed to help you understand your expenses on a whole new level.  It is built to be fast and efficient, so there are short-cuts and key strokes, but no pesky mouse clicks!  You can chart your expenses to see what your top payees are, and you can even perform a k-means cluster analysis to find similar expenses.  This software uses sci-kit-learn to use machine learning to attempt to predict future expenses, too.  Did I need to build this software?  No, but I wanted to because nothing on the market does all of the things that this one does, and even if they did, they would not work exactly how I want them to.  When I do it myself, I get to call every shot and decide how it will work.</p>

		      <h3>AI-Assisted Sound Generator</h3>
                        <p>This was a simple experiment to see if I can use AI to design sounds.  I specifically chose Gemini to put to the test because it has a reputation for being bad a programming.  I had to piece the code snippets together and do lots of debugging, but in the end, our collaboration worked out well.  I chose to target a lot of "color-name" noises (like white noise) since my two young ones find sounds like these to be helpful for good sleep.  I was able to experiment with different frequencies of noise and test their effectiveness.  For fun, I was able to come up with a few other sounds, too.  Gemini came up with a police siren using sin waves, and that impressed me. </p>

                <h3>This Website</h3>
                <p>The website you are viewing right now was designed and built by me with Gemini as a coding assistant.  I used Gemini to short-cut the process of building a blank website - an HTML file with CSS file, then further prompted Gemini to fine tune the overall layout.  From there, I was able to focus on adding content and fine tuning other details by adjusting the HTML and CSS code directly.  This website is a testament to the power of AI to speed up productivity while still allowing the designer to have full creative freedom.  This website is entirely my creation.  The coding was done on a Linux machine using Emacs, and the website was tested locally the same machine using a Chrome browser.

                <h3>3D Printed Valentine's Day Heart Treat Container</h3>
                <p>Using TinkerCAD codeblocks, I designed a printable Valentine's Heart Container you can fill with candy. It features a press-fit lid that fits snug but not too snug. The lid of the heart uses the golden ratio to make each heart proportionally larger beginning from the center heart. I designed a version for MakerSpace that is AMS compatible for a Bambu Labs A1 and a separate version designed to be printed layer by layer with several filament swaps using a Prusa MK3s.</p>
